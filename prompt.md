I want to learn java spring and spring boot framework. I have very basic knowledge on java so I want to start building projects and learn paralelly. Because I don't want to stuck in courses hell and waste time. Please take the role of an experienced java developer and trainer and teach me step by step everything by taking multiple smaller projects and explain me concepts and take me to implementation level of complex projects. Create the complete course in the readme md files formats with perfect index, so that this folder should be one stop solution for the learning Don't ask for any confirmation, create everything.

if you are providing external links and tell to go there for further reading, don't do that, keep everything here only.Also please don't ask confirmation for each file.

Not just this page, complete course is not comprehensive. Your contents should feel like a complete book.

i saw your getting started md file. How can a complete beginner to spring or springboot can understand your code snippet directly.? Please take that into consideration and add more details to all the chapters.
