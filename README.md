# Complete Java Spring & Spring Boot Learning Path

Welcome to the comprehensive Java Spring & Spring Boot learning journey! This repository is designed as a **one-stop solution** for learning Spring framework through practical, hands-on projects that gradually increase in complexity.

## About This Course

This learning path is designed for developers with basic Java knowledge who want to learn Spring and Spring Boot by building real applications. Instead of endless theoretical courses, we focus on:

- Learning through practical implementation
- Building progressively complex projects
- Understanding core concepts through direct application
- Developing professional-level skills through real-world scenarios

## Prerequisites

- Basic Java knowledge (variables, classes, methods, OOP concepts)
- Familiarity with basic programming concepts
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or newer installed
- IDE (IntelliJ IDEA recommended, or Eclipse/VS Code)
- Maven or Gradle (we'll use Maven in most examples)
- Git (optional, for version control)

## Learning Path Structure

This course is structured into 10 progressive projects, complemented by reference guides and learning resources:
